GOOD PAIR:

pair(i, n−i+1)  :   1 <= i < n−i+1
                    s[i] = s[n−i+1]





MOVE:

rearrange   :   good pair = k





APPROACH:
Greedy

=>  count char  :   0 and 1

=> calculate pairs and bad pairs

=> check    :   if enough 0s and 1s to form the required number of bad pairs
                if the remaining can be evenly split into good pairs.
