RULE

each tree   :   cut to fall   :   to the left
                                  to the right.
tree falls  :   occupies a segment on the road    :   left  :   from (position - height) to (position)
                                                      right :   from (position) to (position + height)
                only if the segment it would occupy does not overlap with any other tree's position




APPROACH:
Greedy

=> If there is only one tree, print 1 and exit.

=> initialize   : answer                  : 2
                  last occupied position  : position of first tree

=> process middle trees   :   check if it can fall left or right
      can fall left   :   increment ans
                          update L
      can fall right  :   increment ans
                          update L
      otherwise       :   only update L
