STATEMENT:

start:(0,0)

move    :   integer d   :   0 <= d <= k
                            d-unit forward

alternet  :   move % 2  :   +x
              otherwise :   +y




TASK:

minimum no. of moves to land on (x,y)




APPROACH:
Math + Greedy

=> compute number of k-sized chunks needed for each coordinate
      a   :   how many full or partial k-length moves are required along x axis
      b   :   how many full or partial k-length moves are required along y axis

=> conditionally set move to the minimal number of alternating-direction jumps needed to cover both axes.
