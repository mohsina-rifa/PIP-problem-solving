STATEMENT:

array[i]              : temparature of day-i

minimum requirements  : k-days (consecutive)
maximum temparature   : q degree

no. of possible ways?




APPROACH:
Sliding Window

=> Iterate through each day: 
      build consecutive segment   :   â‰¤ q

=> handle the final segment if it ends with good weather
      if the array ends with good weather : count combinations from that final segment
