difficulty level : 900







UGLY:

contains substrings   :   pie
                          map





OPERATION:

one move  :   delete one character




APPROACH:
Greedy + Sliding-Window

=> initialize   :   pointer i       :   scan the string and
                    counter count   :   accumulate the number of deletions

=> loop   :   while at least three characters remain
      extract the current length-3 segment    :   if "map" or "pie"   :   increment count
                                                                          advance by 3 positions
                                                  otherwise           :   continue loop
