STATEMENT:

clock line    :   within two (of twelve) points
intersect?




APPROACH:
Geometry + Cyclic Order

=> initialize   :   string s    :   record the order of the four special points

=> iterate      :   clockwise
      if encounter endpoints of first chord   :   append 'a'
      if encounter endpoints of second chord  :   append 'b'

=> if recorded sequence is alternating    :   print "YES"
    otherwise                             :   print "NO".
