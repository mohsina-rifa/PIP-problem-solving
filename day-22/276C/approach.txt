difficulty level : 1500







OPERATION:

reorder   :   any way





TASK:

maximize sum of queries





APPROACH:
Greedy

=> initialize frequency array

=> queries    :   increment freq[l]
                  decrement freq[r+1].

=> compute prefix-sums for frequency

=> remove the last extra element  : match the size

=> sort arrays  :   array and frequency

=> multiply corresponding elements  :   sum them
