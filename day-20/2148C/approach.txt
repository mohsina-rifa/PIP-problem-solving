MOVE:

one minute    :   run to other side   :   point += 1
                  stay in place       :   point += 0






TASK:

run     :   until m-th minute
audio   :   n-times
            a[i]-th minute    :   b[i]-th side

maximum point = ?




APPROACH:
Greedy

=> initialize state variables
      pt        :   track the maximum points earned
      px & py   :   keep track of Farmer John's position

=> loop requirement:
    read    :   minute (x)
                required side (y).
                
    increment no. of minutes since last requirement
    
    if John can reach   :   continue
    otherwise           :   decrement
    
    update current time and side
    
    if minutes left after the last requirement    :   add those to the point total
