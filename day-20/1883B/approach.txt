TASK:

make string pallindrome   :   remove k letters
                              reorder in any way




APPROACH:
Frequency-Counting + Parity-Check

=> count char frequency

=> count odd char frequency
      middle position may have a single unique character
      
=> check Palindrome possibility after removals
      if no. of odd-frequency char > k + 1  :   print "NO"
      otherwise                             :   print "YES".
