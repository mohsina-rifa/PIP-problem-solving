TASK:

permutation   :   position-i = 1
                  length([l, r]) = k    :   max element can't be at i




APPROACH:
Greedy

=> check for invalid intervals
      group consecutive '1's
      for each group    :   if length is at least k   :   print "NO" and exit.
                            otherwise                 :   print "YES" 

=> for each position:
      if s[i] is '1'    :   assign increasing numbers starting from 1
      otherwise         :   assign increasing numbers starting from the count of '1's
