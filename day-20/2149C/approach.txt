OPERATION:

choose index    :   replace array[index] with x
                    x = [0, n]





TASK:

min. no. of operation that satisfies  :   MEX(a)^∗ = k




APPROACH:
Greedy

=> count frequency

=> count missing mumbers below k
      all numbers from 0 to k-1 must be present
      each missing number requires one operation to insert

=> console the minimum operation
      if k not present  :   output the number of missing numbers below k
      otherwise         :   count is at least as large as ans   :   output a[k]
                            otherwise                           :   output ans
