difficulty level : 1000







OPERATION:

=> delete first character
=> delete last character





TASK

Make string-1 equal to string-2
    with minimum operation




APPROACH:
Longest-Common-Substring

=> initialize answer  : length of string-1 + length of string-2
                          worst case  : make them empty to match them

=> nested-loop for both string:
      if character equal  :   extend tracking-indices forward 
                                while characters match
      common middle substring   :   compute no. of deletions required
                                    remove everything else
                                    minimize answer
