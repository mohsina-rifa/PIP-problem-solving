TASK:

replace '?' with letters    :   make string-2 substring of string-1
                                    continuous?   :   not required




APPROACH:
Greedy + Two-Pointer

=> convert string into an array of characters
      easy replacement of individual '?'

=> initialize two pointers    :   with 0

=> loop   :   greedy-matching
      current index = '?' :   replace with a[j]
                                increment both pointers.
      otherwise           :   same character in both string   :   increment both pointers
                              otherwise                       :   increment first-pointer

=> refill empty positions with any character
