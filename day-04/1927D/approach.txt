TASK:

find indexes i, j   :   i < j
                        i-th element != j-th element




APPROACH:
Binary-Search

=> add extra 0 at beginning
    for correct indexing.

=> build shortcut vector  : array[index] != array[index+1].
      to find valid answer pair

=> start query:
      perform binary-search
          find the smallest index value >= left-range
          greater value?  :   adjust right-range
                              update answer                  

=> answer within limit  : print answer and answer+1
    otherwise           : print -1 -1
