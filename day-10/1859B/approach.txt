Greedy

=> loop array:
      reads size and elements
      find    :   smallest element
                  second smallest element

=> sort helper arrays

=> calculate the Maximum Beauty
      initialize the answer with the smallest minimum from all arrays
      add the second smallest values from the rest of the arrays
