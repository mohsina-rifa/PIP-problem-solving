Machines:

A   :   x := x − 1
B   :   x := | x / 2 |




APPROACH:
Brute Force

=> ount no of machines of type 'B'

=> iterate
      take its initial value  : if no 'B'                   : print current-value
      current_val > 0         : iterate through the machine : increment answer
                                                              apply machine's update  : A : decrement by 1
                                                                                        B: floor divide by 2
                                                              current-value = 0       : break the inner loop
=> print the accumulated answer
