STATEMENT:

sequence = {r, g, y}  : cyclic

cross         : when g
current-time  : unknown

find minimum time to guarantee cross




APPROACH:
Suffix-Scan

=> duplicate string : handle wrap-around

=> array next-green : length m
      initialize with the index of the next 'g'
          if none: -1

=> loop :   every position i in t
        remember the most recent 'g' index
        s[i] == c   :   read next-green[i]
        update ans with the distance to that 'g'.
