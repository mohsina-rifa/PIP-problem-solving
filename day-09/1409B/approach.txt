STATEMENT:

product to minimize : a , b
lowest value        : a : x
                      b : y
maximum move        : n

find minimum possible product of a and b




APPROACH:
Greedy

=> decrease a as much as possible
    decrease b for remaining moves
      calculate product

=> decrease b as much as possible
    decrease a for remaining moves
      calculate product

=> take lowest product
