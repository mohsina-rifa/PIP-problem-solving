RULE:

Alice eats candies from the left side   :   1, 2, 3, ...
Bob eats candies from the right side    :   n, n-1, n-2, ...




APPROACH:
Prefix-Suffix sum + Two-pointer

=> find sum
    prefixsum[i] = total weight of candies from position 0 to i     :   Alice
    suffixsum[j] = total weight of candies from position j to n-1   :   Bob

=> three cases:
    prefixsum[i] = suffixsum[j]   :   candies = (i+1) + (n-j)
                                      move both pointers
    prefixsum[i] < suffixsum[j]   :   move alice-pointer
    prefixsum[i] > suffixsum[j]   :   move bob-pointer
