STATEMENT

base            = no. of elements
maximum water   = x units

height          = biggest possible





APPROACH:
Binary search

=> sort array
    for binary search

=> set values for binary-search:
    left    smallest array-element
    right   biggest array-element

=> minimum height: smallest array-element

=> get a cost variable: initially 0

=> binary-search : until left <= right
    find mid
    calculate required amount of water for current step
        initially 0
    check for all elements:
        update required :   add (mid - current-element)
            only if current-element smaller than mid
        update height requirement:
            required > maximum  :   move right to left  (mid-1)
            otherwise           :   move left to right  (mid+1)     :   update height

=> print height
