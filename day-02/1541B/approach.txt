GOOD PAIR:

i < j 
arr[i] Ã— arr[j] = i + j 




APPROACH:
Brute-force+Pruning

=> map position with input      :       mp[value] = position

=> limit = 2*n-1;

=> sort

=> keep a counter   :   initially 0

=> loop:
        product > limit                 :       early termination
        product= good-pair constraint   :       increment count
