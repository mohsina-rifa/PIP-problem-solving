OPERATIONS

choose an index
replace value with value of next index





APPROACH:
Greedy = Number-Theory

=> initialize a variable to store the minimum-moves needed to a large values
        and a counter with 0    :   to be used for k=4

=> loop through each array-element.
    k=4 case    :   if current array-element is even    :   increment even_count
    otherwise   :   moves needed to make smallest array-element the next multiple of k 
                        =>  ((k-(arr[i]%k))%k)
                    minimum-moves = min(minimum-moves, moves-needed)
    if current-element is even   :   increment even-count

=> k=4 case :   calculate the cost of getting two even numbers and compare

=> print minimum numbers
