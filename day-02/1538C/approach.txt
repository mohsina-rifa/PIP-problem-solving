difficulty level : 1300







REQUIRED:

pairs(i,j)            :   1 <= i < j <= n
array[i] + array[j]   :   l <= array[i]+array[j] <= r




APPROACH:
Two-pointer + inclusion-exclusion

=> sort

=> define helper function   :   to count the number of pairs
      counter is initialized to 0. 
      Two pointers  : left and right  : initialized with first and last elements
      continues     : till left pointer < the right pointer.
                      checks sum      : if a[left] + a[right] <= value  : add right-left to counter
      called with the upper bound     : number of pairs whose sum is less than or equal to r.
      called with l - 1               : number of pairs whose sum is less than l.

=> print (Number of pairs with sum ≤ r) - (Number of pairs with sum ≤ l-1)
