difficulty level : 1200







OPERATION:

choose i  : swap elements : idex i and i+1





GOAL:
make it all 'a' together and all 'b' together?
  which letter first? ===> doesn't matter
find minimum no. of operation to do it




APPROACH:
Median-Based Grouping

=> Helper function  :   for operation
    collect positions of characters
      + handle empty case   :   no swaps needed
    central anchor  :   median occurrence index
      calculate absolute distance   : current-position to target-position

=> calculate with helper function   : for both a and b
