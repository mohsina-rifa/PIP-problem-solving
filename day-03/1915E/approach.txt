SENARIO:

i-th glass  : array[i] unit juice
drinks from : Lucia     : odd indexed glasses
                            1, 3, 5 ... 2n-3, 2n-1
              her date  : even indexed glasses
                            2, 4, 6 ... 2n-2, 2n
         
         
         
         
                            
TASK:

find sub-array  : sum of even-index = sum of odd-index





APPROACH:
Alternating Prefix-Sum + Hashing

=> Map    :   record seen prefix sums

=> variable  temporary-sum   :   initialize with 0; 

=> count = 1  : for sum = 0.

=> loop   :   form alternating prefix
                check for repeated sum
      update sign-adjusted value  :   element of current index * (+1 for even i, âˆ’1 for odd i), 
                                          positive  : for even
                                          negative  : for odd
      
      
      if current sum was seen before  : print YES
                                        stop execution
      otherwise                       : increment count for current-sum in map

=> nothing printed after loop?  :   print NO
