STATEMENT:

new-set   :   1 to m
              at least once
                more than once? === doesn't matter
three such sets must exist




APPROACH:
frequency-count + scan-heuristic

=> map    :   how many sets each number appears in

=> check each sets  : every element appears in at least two different input sets?
                        YES   :   increment counter

=> verify map   : each value (1-m) exists?
                    NO    :   counter reset to 0

=> counter >=2    : print YES
    otherwise     : print NO
