INTERESTING PAIR

teacher-array[i]+teacher-array[j]   >   student-array[i]+student-array[j]




APPROACH:
Binary-Search

=> difference-array   :   drr[i] = arr[i] - brr[i]
    to simplify the problem   :   from  : arr[i]+arr[j] > brr[i]+brr[j]
                                  to    : drr[i] + drr[j] > 0

=> dort the difference-array

=> loop:
    for each drr[i] : find partner  : j > i
                                      drr[j] > -drr[i]

=> binary search on the rest of the array

=> first valid partner found
    all elements after the current index  === valid partners
    because the array is sorted

=> increment counter with (n - current-index)

=> print counter
