STATEMENT:

potion-i  :   adds/subtracts health[i]

start from 0  : go rightwards   : may/may not drink
      find highest no of bottoms up




APPROACH:
Greedy + Max-Heap

=> track    :     health as we simulate drinking
                  how many potions are currently chosen
                  magnitudes of negative potions that were accepted

=> helper popMax  :     finds, removes, and returns the largest element in heap
                        undefined if empty

=> Iterate:
      current potion value    :     negative    :     push its absolute value into heap
                                                      increment answer
                                                      add current-value to total

=> drink the current potion   :     total = negative  :     remove the previously chosen negative potion
                                                            decrement ans.
