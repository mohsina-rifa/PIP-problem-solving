STATEMENT:

input     : permutation : integer 1 to n

Query     : value
            find position   :   array[position] = value
        
strategy  : Vasya : linear search from the beginning to the end. 
                    position-p  : p comparisons.
            Petya : linear search from the end of the array to the beginning
                    position-p  : n-p+1 comparisons.




APPROACH:
Preprocessing + Direct-Lookup

=> build position lookup with 1-based index of that value in the permutation

=> query  :  value
        lookup its position p
        add p to Vasya
        add (nâˆ’p+1) to Petya
