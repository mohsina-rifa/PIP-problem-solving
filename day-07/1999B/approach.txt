STATEMENT:

round = 2

move  : choose one unflipped card
        flip it

win   : round   : player whose flipped card has strictly larger value
        overall : player who won strictly more rounds

find possible no of games won by Suneet




APPROACH:
Brute-Force

=>  Suneet=a VS Slavic=c
    Suneet=b VS Slavic=d        :       conditional increment

=>  Suneet=a VS Slavic=c
    Suneet=b VS Slavic=d        :       conditional increment
    
=>  multiply with 2 for finding pair
