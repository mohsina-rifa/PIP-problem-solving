difficulty level : 900







STATEMENT:

must send   :   n messages    :   at strictly increasing integer times

initial               :   f units of charge
one unit time         :   f--
turn on or turn off   :   b units of charge

may toggle and send a message at the same moment





TASK

schedule on/off toggles   :   without recharging
                              the phone must be on at every mi
                              charge never drops to <= 0




APPROACH:
Greedy

=> initialize   :   previous = 0    :   phone initial condition
                    ok = true       :   confirm possibility

=> iterate
      compute time gap    :   current message to previous moment
      compute energy consumed   :   phone stayed on through the gap   :   if less than b    :   consider energy
                                                                          otherwise         :   consider b
      deduct the chosen cost from the remaining charge    :   if less than or equal zero    :   break

=> print "YES" or "NO" accordingly
