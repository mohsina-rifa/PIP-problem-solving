CONDITION:

climb   :   when leg <= height





APPROACH:
Prefix-Sum + Binary-Search

=> build prefix-sum & max-height
          update    :   running sum of heights
                        maximum step height so far
          store pairs of [max, sum] in vector

=> sort the array vec by the maximum step height

=> build prefix-max for sum
          update each entry in vector   :   sum value = maximum possible sum up to that point

=> answer query   :   binary search
