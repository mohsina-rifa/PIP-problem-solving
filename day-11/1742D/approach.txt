TASK

max-sum(pair(i,j))  :   array[i] and array[j] are coprime




APPROACH:
Brute-Force

=> initialize an array to store the maximum index for each possible value to quickly look up the last occurrence

=> check all pairs of values    :   if co-prime   :   update the maximum sum of their indices
                                    otherwise     :   pass
