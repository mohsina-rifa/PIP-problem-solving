SENARIO:

monster-i   :   health = array
ability     :   choose monter with highest ability    :   does k-damage
                                                          if multiple such monster    : choose lowest index
health >= 0 :   monster dies




APPROACH:
Sorting

=> for each monster     :   store a tuple of [rem, -i]
      calculate the remainder of health when divided by k. 
    if remainder = 0    :   set it to k. S for each monster.

=> sort the array of [rem, -i] pairs
      1.  by rem    :   ascending   :   higher remainder == survive longer
      2.  by index  :   descending  :   ties are broken by the smallest index
