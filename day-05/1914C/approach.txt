difficulty level : 1100







QUEST:

Q-1 :   always available
Q-i :   when all previous quests are done.





POINT

Q-i :   1st completion  :   array-1[i] points
        re-completion   :   array-2[i] points





TASK

maximum experience    :   by k tasks




APPROACH:
Greedy + Prefix-sum

=> build prefix sums of array-1

=> initialize tracking variables
        running maximum of b seen so far.
        track best total experience from auxiliary accumulator for the k > n branch.

=> set new limit for the main loop:
        consider finishing first i+1 quests, then repeat best b
        Updated maximum
        k exceeds n     :       accumulate all first-completion rewards 
                                track the global max across all quests
                                adjust max by adding (n - k) * max before comparing with max_exp.

=> output result
