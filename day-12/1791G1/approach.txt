MOVE:

left      :   1 coin
right     :   1 coin
teleport  :   array[i] coins





TASK

total coin  :   c
max no of teleport?




APPROACH:
Greedy

=> calculate total cost for each teleporter:
        cost to reach position i from 0
        +   cost to use the teleporter

=> sort costs in ascending order

=> use the cheapest available options to maximize the number of teleporters

=> iterate cost:
        if enough coins remain  :   use the teleporter
                                    subtract its cost from total
        increments answer for each successful use
        stop when insufficient for next teleporter
