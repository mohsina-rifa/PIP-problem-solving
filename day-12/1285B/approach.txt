MOVES:

Yasser  :   one of each type
Adel    :   choose a segment != whole array
            one of each type from that segment





TASK:

if happiness(Yasser) > happiness(Adel)  :   YES
otherwise                               :   NO




APPROACH:
Kadane's algorithm

=> calculate total tastiness for Yasser   :   distinct elements

=> find maximum subarray sum for prefix
        from the first element, exclude last element

=> find maximum subarray sum for
        from the second element to the last, exclude first element
                                  
=> compare Yasser’s total with Adel’s best possible segment
